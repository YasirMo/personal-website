## Artificial intelligence 

In the last two years, the fashion industry has experienced substantial economic and
social growth; however, the industry is currently facing a lack of technological innovation
and sustainability issues. The issue in the Fashion industry is the lack of
sustainability, resource allocation, fabric waste, and technological solutions behind the
design and engineering of clothes.


## Digital Media

Digital media is a traditional solution currently being used in the fashion industry, in which brands utilise video editing and 3D graphics to generate fashion images. According to
McKinsey's State of Fashion, 30% of the fashion industry sees adopting digital solutions
as an opportunity. The Covid-19 pandemic is one of the biggest motivations for the current popularity of digital solutions. Although digital media solutions have shown promising results, their production speed is slow.

## GANS
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human problem-solving in a machine; the
term is applied to machines that exhibit intelligent human behaviour.
AI has swept various industries in recent years, providing creative solutions to problems
and competitive insights. Despite the fashion industry's restricted business model, AI will
continue to impact the sector, such as the fashion industry's design process. Within AI, machine learning is one of the most popular techniques widely applied in
various industrial applications, especially for image generation.
